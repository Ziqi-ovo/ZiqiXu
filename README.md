# Hi, there :)

I'm Ziqi and my past work was relevent to **Continuous RnT Model for 2D Active Particles** using Python and **Formal Proof of Dual Numbers by LEAN 4**. I'm currently studying **MPI and OpenMP**, and will work in **HPC field** with C++ for my MPhil thesis at Cambridge.

My repositories are private due to university academic integrity policies! If you're interested in my code, I'm happy to provide collaborator access or a code walkthrough during our chat!
